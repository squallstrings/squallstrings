## 🎯 Featured Projects

### 🔍 [Kyubey-scan](https://github.com/squallstrings/kyubey-scan)
Open-source OSINT tool for security research and reconnaissance. Built with Go for performance and reliability.

### 🎲 Boogie Woogie Method *(In Development)*
A moving-target defense runtime for indirect control flow that reduces the reliability of pointer-based exploitation and memory hooks by making dispatch targets time-bound and non-stable during execution.
The goal is not to prevent cheating outright, but to increase attacker cost and detection surface by expiring static exploitation assumptions at runtime.
